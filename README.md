# 12th_assignment

Make and android program with a blank screen. The program listens to touch gestures and responds them in this way:

Swiping-like Fling-motion modifies the application background colour so that the velocity value in x-axis controls 
the redness of the colour and velocity value of the y-axis controls the blueness of the colour. 
The higher the velocity, the more intense the colour and vice versa.

Double-tapping makes the screen go black or white if the screen is black already
